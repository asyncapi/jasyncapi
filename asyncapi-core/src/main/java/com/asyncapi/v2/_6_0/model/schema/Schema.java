        Schema Annotations

        Schema validation is a useful mechanism for annotating instance data
        with additional information.  The rules for determining when and how
        annotations are associated with an instance are outlined in section
        3.3.

        These general-purpose annotation keywords provide commonly used
        information for documentation and user interface display purposes.
        They are not intended to form a comprehensive set of features.
        Rather, additional vocabularies can be defined for more complex
        annotation-based applications.

        String-Encoding Non-JSON Data

        Foreword

        Properties defined in this section indicate that an instance contains
        non-JSON data encoded in a JSON string.  They describe the type of
        content and how it is encoded.

        These properties provide additional information required to interpret
        JSON data as rich multimedia documents.

        Implementation Requirements

        The content keywords function as both annotations (Section 3.3) and
        as assertions (Section 3.2).  While no special effort is required to
        implement them as annotations conveying how applications can
        interpret the data in the string, implementing validation of
        conformance to the media type and encoding is non-trivial.

        Implementations MAY support the "contentMediaType" and
        "contentEncoding" keywords as validation assertions.  Should they
        choose to do so, they SHOULD offer an option to disable validation
        for these keywords.
